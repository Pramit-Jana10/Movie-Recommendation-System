# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

> Single GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks: `MRS_WEB.ipynb` and `MRS_MAIN.ipynb`.


## Project Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that together form a single project. The notebooks appear to be related to a web / data analysis workflow (inferred from the filename `MRS_WEB.ipynb`) and an auxiliary notebook (`MRS_MAIN.ipynb`). This README gives instructions for setting up the environment, running the notebooks locally, and suggestions for organizing the repository for sharing on GitHub.


## Files in this repo

* `MRS_WEB.ipynb` — Primary notebook. Likely contains the main code, web-related analysis, or web app demonstration. Open this notebook to see the project entrypoint.
* `MRS_MAIN.ipynb` — Secondary notebook. Possibly contains helper analysis, experiments, or utilities used by the primary notebook.

## Requirements

Minimum environment suggestions:

* Python 3.9+ (3.8 may work for many packages)
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* pip

Typical Python packages commonly used by notebooks (adjust as needed):

* notebook
* jupyterlab
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* requests
* flask or fastapi 


## Setup / Installation

1. Clone the repository


2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it


3. Install dependencies




## How to run the notebooks

Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook in the repository folder and open either notebook.

Open `MRS_WEB.ipynb` first (it is the primary notebook). Follow any instructions inside the notebook cells — for example, set paths to datasets, enable/disable code cells that start a server, or run sections in order.
